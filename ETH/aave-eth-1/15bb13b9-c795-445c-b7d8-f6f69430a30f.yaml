      Aave is an open source non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users
      to receive interest on their 

      cryptocurrency investments and borrow digital assets through
      over-collateralized loans.


      Aavenomics refers to the tokenkomics of the Aave protocol and it presents
      a governance framework to grant decision 

      making powers to AAVE token holders. Aavenomics represents the autonomy
      granted to the protocol and the AAVE token 

      as a core securing element of the Aave Protocol. Aavenomics functions
      based on a unique risk incentivization 

      framework. The Aave holders bear the risk of the protocol and in return
      they are incentivized.


      The holders of Aave tokens who stake the coin can participate in the
      security module and earn a yield of  around 7% 

      as the compensation for contributing to the security of the protocol. In
      exchange, their staked $AAVE tokens could 

      be slashed up to 30% in the event of a liquidity crisis for the protocol. 


      Aave is secured by a Safety Module which serves as a staking mechanism for
      AAVE tokens to act as insurance against 

      Shortfall Events. Stakers can earn Safety  Incentives along with a certain
      percentage of the protocol fees.


      Staked AAVE will be freely tradable after a cooldown period. All rewards
      accrue in real time and are distributed 

      as AAVE is withdrawn or transferred from the Safety Module.

      AAVE, the governance token of the Aave protocol, is an ERC-20 token that
      runs on the Ethereum blockchain which needs 

      to be earned instead of being minted.


      The ways to earn Aave include buying it on exchanges and then staking it
      within the protocol’s “safety module.”

      Aave Protocol offers governance powers and financial rewards.


      AAVE, the governance token of the protocol, grants the token holders the
      right to make proposals, cast their vote on 

      protocol parameters and decide on new parameters in the ecosystem. The
      token shares the power between stakeholders 

      within the Aave ecosystem in order to secure the Aave Protocol.


      The components of Aave Genesis governance architecture's smart contracts
      are


      ### **Aave proto governance**


      Aave proto governance is a core component of governance which allows
      voting by the LEND token holders and permits 

      the execution of approved proposals. Only LEND tokens are allowed to vote
      with one token being equivalent to one vote.


      This contract includes the ownerships needed to execute the proposals
      containing all the bootstrapping actions of 

      the Aave ecosystem. Asset Voting Weight Provider defines weights a voter
      can vote on proposals.


      ### **Governance Process**


      The Governance Process is undertaken via governance forums at
      governance.aave.com and ratified through on-chain Aave Improvement
      Proposals (AIPs) using AAVE.

      The AAVE token empowers holders to collectively act as governors of the
      protocol by enabling them with the capability to vote and propose.

      Aave’s safety module serves the dual purpose of providing security to the
      platform and incentivizing the token 

      holders. The token holders are incentivized to lock tokens into a Smart
      Contract-based component called the Safety 

      Module (SM).


      The tokens deposited here act as a cushion incase of a short fall event,
      wherein a deficit arises and funds are 

      required. The occurrence of a shortfall event involves selling off the
      locked AAVE by the process of auctioning in 

      order to set off the deficit.


      The presence of a built-in backstop mechanism prevents excess flow of AAVE
      ensuring that the value of Aave itself 

      is not reduced. The AAVE holders secure the protocol by locking AAVE
      tokens in return for receiving rewards, in the form 

      of Safety Incentives (SI).


      To contribute to the safety of the protocol and receive incentives, AAVE
      holders deposit their tokens into the Safety Module 

      and receive a tokenized position.


      The share from the Safety Module can be redeemed by the holder of the
      tokenized position at any time, triggering a cooldown period of one week.


      The main role of the Safety Module is to protect the protocol against
      unexpected loss of funds arising from various 

      shortfall events which include


      * **Smart contract risk** : The risks of a bug in the system, design flaw
      or potential attack surfaces on the smart 

      contract layer.


      * **Liquidation risk** : The risk of failure of an asset that is being
      used as collateral on Aave.


      * **Oracle failure risk** : Risk of the Oracle system not properly
      updating the prices in case of extreme market 

      downturn and network congestion; risk of the Oracle system not properly
      submitting prices, causing improper 

      liquidations.

      Financial incentives are used to shape behaviors within the Aave ecosystem
      with the objective of achieving a common 

      objective. For Aave, the common goal is to ensure the safety of the Aave
      Protocol, cost-efficient usage by the market 

      participants, and proper ecosystem incentives to drive innovation and
      long-term growth of the ecosystem.


      AAVE holders get to participate in two type of incentives


      ### 1. Safety Incentives (SI)      

      Safety Incentives ensure the safety of the protocol by incentivizing AAVE
      holders to participate in the Safety 

      Module. This is achieved with a set of incentives pushing behavior to
      naturally create a positive feedback loop 

      within the Aave Protocol. In that sense, the essence of those systemic
      incentives is to materially fade away while 

      having a lasting impact on participants' behavior. This behavior
      materializes with the birth of policy motivated 

      agents that have incorporated the sustainability of the system they now
      belong to.


      AAVE holders participating in the Safety Module earn both Safety
      Incentives in the form of AAVE and fees from the protocol.


      SI rewards are subject to a cooldown period of seven days where tokens are
      unclaimable.

      However, fees generated by the protocol are continuously allocated to the
      users participating in the SM and can be 

      withdrawn and are redistributed to the SI participants.

      The participants are incentivized with the rewards for contributing to the
      safety of the protocol in its early stages.

      The SI emission is controlled by the governance and adjusted to the
      protocol's needs.


      ### 2. Ecosystem Incentives (EI)      

      Represents the part of the periodic issuance of AAVE (EI) used to
      incentivize liquidity providers, software 

      developers and integrators to build value within the Aave ecosystem.
