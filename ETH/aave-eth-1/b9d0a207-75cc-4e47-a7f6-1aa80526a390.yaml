      # **Overview**


      ![Aave](https://2799188404-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-MDtoSpz9ekPafgSK8Bl%2F-MDvO-yzDivYrBvizXRW%2F-MDvO2lOYLIPFLa6WEUO%2Faave%20overview.png?alt=media&token=5a4c8be8-d473-4041-b58c-a37234bd15fd
      "Aave")


      Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol built on the
      Ethereum blockchain where users can provide liquidity to earn interest or
      borrow by providing collateral of tokens owned. It is completely
      open-source so people can build third-party solutions on the Aave Protocol
      via API or by directly interacting with the smart contracts on the
      Ethereum Network.


      Currently, Aave has integrated with a number of L1 (Polygon, Avalanche)
      and L2 (Arbitrum) networks. It is also a decentralized organization and is
      governed by the community via the AAVE token which is used to vote for the
      growth of the DAO based on Aave Improvement Proposals (AIP). 


      Beyond voting, AAVE can also be staked in within the Protocol Safety
      Module to provide Insurance to depositors on the Protocol.

      # **Aave Grants DAO**


      The Aave Grants DAO is basically a program that funds the ideas of
      contributors who want to build products on the Aave Protocol. This program
      is community-led in that the ideas and eventually products built are all
      from the community.


      The mission of Aave Grants DAO is to build a network (ecosystem) of
      contributors at Aave and be at the forefront of the development of
      products built on the Aave Protocol. Lastly, Aave encourages great talent
      to leverage the open-source Protocol to build awesome products, organize
      events, spread the word of Aave to the world, etc.


      To date, about 81 grants have been given out to contributors at a budget
      of $1,957,250 and 30 events have been sponsored at a budget of $848139
      totaling $2,805,389 since May 2021.


      Some of the interesting grants awarded to developers building awesome
      products on Aave are highlighted below:


      * Protecting users - Cono Finance by Gelato Network, Aave Liquidation
      Notifier by Steven Li

      * Onboarding and attracting new users - Aave quests on Rabbithole, 2001
      DeFi developing a mobile app for Aave, Blockchain Education Network
      enabling any student to participate in Aave governance

      * Increasing liquidity - Symphony Finance’s yield generating limit orders,
      and Sacred Finance’s privacy-preserving DeFi protocol

      * Analyzing the protocol - a growth dashboard by Omni Analytics, community
      enabled analytics program by Flipside Crypto

      * Improving oversight and transparency - Safeguard by Tally


      The priority areas that Aave Grants DAO focuses on are as follows:


      1. Protocol development

      2. Applications and integrations

      3. Developer tooling

      4. Code audits

      5. Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem

      6. Community (marketing and educational)

      7. Events & hackathons

      # **Rewards**


      For contributors who want to build via the Aave Grants DAO, there are two
      levels of funding available depending on the size of the idea, product or
      project. They are broken down below:


      * Rapid grants: &lt;$100k
          * Simple process to apply for a grant to AGD
          * Grant decision expected within 10 days
      * Community grants: $100k-$500k
          * Applicants post a proposal on Aave’s governance forum
          * Based on feedback and discussion, the committee can decide to approve these grants

      Contributors who apply for grants above $500k will have to go through an
      on-chain vote after posting on the Aave’s Governance Forum.


      More information about the rewards can be found
      [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642)
