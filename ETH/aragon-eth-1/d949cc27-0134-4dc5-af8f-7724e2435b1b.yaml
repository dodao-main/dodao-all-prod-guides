      ## About Aragon

      Aragon allows you to quickly and easily create an organization that can
      adapt to the various decentralization challenges. It offers a set of
      applications and services that enable new forms of global community.


      Tokens, currency, and capital assets are ways for communities to organize,
      and these assets will gain in value as more people use and hold them.


      In addition to providing basic financial tools like tokenization, Argon
      can design reproducible and broadly applicable templates for defining the
      boundaries of a community and transferring value to contributors over the
      internet without traditional intermediaries. For instance, the solution
      Aragon Court can be used to resolve dispute.


      Aragon Protocol can be used to manage and create decentralized autonomous
      organizations (DAOs) on top of the Ethereum blockchain, with plans to
      expand to other chains in the future. It can also be used to create clubs,
      companies, non-profits, and other organizations involved in finances and
      decision-making through its decentralized apparatus.


      ![Aragon](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1vgMcTZxzh2sLroh-VzhTdRafNAZbgEng)


      For Web3 communities and organizations, Aragon is building the future of
      decentralized governance. Aragon's open-source stack allows you to deploy
      a DAO, manage your community, solve disputes, and run enterprise-level
      votes.


      Aragon's native cryptocurrency, ANT and ANJ, is the heart of managing the
      DAOs on its platform, allowing owners to vote on key decisions and also 
      used to participate in the governance of the Aragon Network DAO and its
      Aragon Court dispute resolution system.


      Many communities are using Aragon DAO to build a decentralized economy
      including BrightID, Decentraland, PieDAO, LexDAO, and many more.

      # Aragon Client and Aragon Govern 

      You can create a DAO using Aragon, you can choose between Aragon’s client
      or govern, and it depends on what you want to achieve.


      ## Aragon client 


      A toolkit for developers to create customizable online organizations aimed
      at facilitating greater transparency. It is the portal to your
      organization. Use the client to create your organization and navigate
      between apps to perform actions. It can help fundraise, manage finances,
      and reward contributors.


      If you need a decentralized Human resource for your community, Aragon
      client can provide all you need. 


      * **Attract Contributions**: Automated payroll for contributors that join
      your community and work together.

      * **Pool Capital**: Gather funds from people around the world who share
      common values.

      * **Govern Transparently**: Participate in group decisions and make
      financial decisions that are transparent.


      Aragon client gives provide templates to make your creation of DAO easy,
      and it also gives the admin and community access to

      * Minime Token

      * Traditional voted governance

      * DAO templates

      * Extensible with plugins

      * Aragon Client is trusted by 2000+ DAOs.


      ## Aragon Govern
       An on-chain governance framework that supports frictionless DAO execution with plug-in dispute resolution. The benefits of using this framework include;
      * **Simple and Low-cost** : Execute on-chain executions that can be
      challenged in Aragon Court by any token holder.

      * **Voteless Execution** : Assign orders, but avoid expensive, arduous
      votes on uncontroversial matters.

      * **Scalable governance** : Scalable and high-speed governance that
      disables bad actors.

      Aragon Govern creates DAOs in accordance with written, subjective
      agreements between all participants. In order to reduce the scope of
      interpretation, these documents should be written carefully and cover as
      many scenarios as possible. However, any transaction that is deemed
      contrary to the DAO agreement may be challenged in Aragon Court.


      Aragon Govern provides Optimistic Governance for Web3 community.
      Optimistic governance allows all proposals to be implemented except it is
      challenge in Aragon court.


      The Optimistic Governance model assumes that all actions are legitimate
      until proven otherwise, sometimes called the 'lazy' consensus. As a
      result, governance becomes an endless cycle of proposals that execute
      automatically as on-chain transactions unless they are explicitly
      challenged by the DAO in Aragon Court during Dispute Time Delay.


      Aragon Govern gives admin and community access to 

      * Optimistic governance

      * ERC20 token

      * Simple and cost effective

      * Frictionless governance

      * Fast decision making

      * No voting needed

      ## The Aragon Court

      As an alternative to smart contracts, Aragon Court allows users to settle
      disputes between organizations that are hosted on the Aragon network. It
      can be used as a plug-in for any decentralized application and can be
      accessed via API by any decentralized application (dApp) using the Aragon
      OpenStack.


      * **Subjective Dispute Resolution** : Smart contracts alone cannot resolve
      subjective disputes that are not handled by a decentralized dispute
      resolution protocol.

      * **A Network of Guardians** : We are creating an international network of
      incentivized guardians, ready to intervene in disputes and arbitrate the
      results.

      * **Human-centered Sybil Resistance** : Create well-written,
      human-readable agreements that are protected by the Aragon Court.


      The software allows other users (called jurors) to review arguments and
      vote based on what they think about each dispute. ANT holders can become
      jurors by exchanging their ANT coins for ANJ tokens, which must then be
      staked, or locked in special contracts on the Aragon network. The more ANJ
      a user stakes, the greater the chance they’ll be selected as a juror.


      Jurors who resolve the argument receive rewards in ANT coins, and the DAO
      updates any rules or outcomes in software programmatically.


      Aragon court’s jurors can update to guardians. And these guardians stake a
      token called ANT which allows them to be drafted into guardians and earn
      fees for successfully adjudicating disputes.


      The Aragon Court Dispute Lifecycle

      * Dispute Creation and Evidence Submission

      * Summoning Guardians
       * Vote Commit
      * Vote Reveal

      * Appeal and Confirmation

      * Final Ruling & Final Appeal Round


      ## Aragon Voice
       A decentralized, cost-effective, and secure solution for creating and managing proposals and voting. Aragon Voice powers unstoppable decentralized governance in Web 3.0 via its voting infrastructure. Providing premium ballots or permissionless signalling will boost your community engagement and trust. 

      Benefits of Aragon voice include

      * **Unique Guarantees** : Open source, and end-to-end verification of the
      Ethereum main network as well as Aragon Layer 2 vote tallying.

      * **Flexible & Modular** : Supports both single and multiple question
      voting, as well as real-time or encrypted results. 

      * **Free Voting** : Offering 100% free voting to token holders increases
      engagement and participation levels.

      * **Permissionless Voting** : Anyone can access and interact with AragonOS
      voting infrastructure, which can be incorporated into any protocol or
      dApp.


      Aragon voice is building more features for its users including

      * Insured binding execution using Aragon Court

      * Free proposal creation

      * Weighted voting

      * Quadratic voting

      * Range voting

      ## Aragon network

      A community of decentralized, autonomous organizations that interact via
      the platform. The Aragon Network Token (ANT) is the main coordination
      mechanism of the Aragon Network DAO. Holders of the ANT are able to make
      proposals, vote on those proposals, and participate in the resolution of
      disputes within the Aragon Network DAO. The structure as we shown above
      include


      * **Main DAO** : Open to all ANT holders. Make proposals and vote on the
      way we use the DAO’s Investment Vault, and the rules governing the
      community.

      * **Executive sub-DAO** : Elected committee that facilitates strategic
      alignment across the Aragon Network DAO and allocates funds from the
      Sub-DAO’s treasury (The Operations Vault).

      * **Compliance sub-DAO** : Elected committee that facilitates
      conversations on ethics, risk and sustainability, and is equipped with
      veto power to guard the network.

      * **Tech committee** : Elected committee that checks and integrates code
      submissions, and organizes tech audits as needed.

      Aragon court: See details above


      ## Vocdoni
       An all-in-one secure voting platform by Aragon.  The Vocdoni project builds scalable, decentralized, universally verifiable and anonymous digital voting infrastructure. 

      This project represents a new paradigm for digital voting as compared to
      existing solutions which rely solely on a blockchain for vote
      traceability, employ closed-source software and even operate as a
      centralized service. 


      The Vocdoni Platform is an Open Platform, where anyone can participate,
      including voters, institutions, and third parties. To make decentralized
      governance possible, it is crucial that any actor within the ecosystem can
      integrate their own tools and services.

      Its benefits include

      * **Secure Voting** : a voting protocol that is both flexible and secure
      and can be used for any type of voting process: single-choice, weighted,
      and more to come.

      * **Auditable and GDPR-compliant**: Our software offers legally auditable
      reports on voting results as well as GDPR compliance to protect users'
      privacy.

      * **Complete Transparency**: The use of open-source code and extensive
      technical and nontechnical documents ensures incomparable transparency for
      developers and voters.


      All aspects of Vocdoni voting protocol have been explicitly designed to be
      secure.


      We can create a secure, transparent and well-protected governance
      infrastructure through the use of decentralized technologies.


      We can also enable anonymous voting using cryptographic mechanisms, such
      as zk-SNARKs, while maintaining complete transparency and auditability.


      Vocdoni gives its user more control over their data by using a
      self-sovereign identity scheme.

      Keys identifying the user are generated and stored in the user's terminal
      along with their other information. An exchange protocol allows you to
      share the necessary credentials with the organization's servers so that
      they can verify users.

      A built-in consent mechanism generates a signature to indicate how the
      data should be used. This allows complete control of the current and
      historical use of the data by the user, while allowing organizations to
      manage their data with full GDPR compliance.
