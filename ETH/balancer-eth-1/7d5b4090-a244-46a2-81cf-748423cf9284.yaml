      # **Overview**


      Balancer is a Protocol built on Ethereum that works as an automated
      portfolio management and trading platform where fees are collected from
      traders to rebalance portfolios by leveraging arbitrage opportunities. 


      Also, as a community-driven organization, Balancer’s governance process is
      decentralized and is operated by members of the community who hold the
      governance token. For Balancer, the governance token is veBAL (locked
      B-80BAL-20WETH) and is used for every decision-making process within the
      organization.


      Governance points groups or individuals to provide services to the
      protocol, who must bring forward a proposal through the Balancer Forum for
      discussion and voting (Snapshot). These SPs (Service Providers) present a
      long-term commitment to the protocol and a broad scope of work. The
      proposal must also include the team's credentials, expected metrics and
      KPIs (key performance indicators).

      # **Balancer Grants**


      Balancer Grants is a committee that runs an independent community-owned
      grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP) under
      the DAO operating framework. 


      The grants program provides support and funding to projects committed to
      supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number
      one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and
      individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer
      Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the
      Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost
      beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding
      smaller, short term or one off projects.


      The Grants Committee is a group of diverse and experienced Balancer
      contributors.

      # **Applications**


      For Q4/2022, Balancer Grants has 95,000 BAL in funds to support and fund
      projects that are willing to build on Balancer and develop the Balancer
      ecosystem.


      But what does a successful grant submission look like?


      You can find more information on how to build your application
      [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFKt8QHfcuea_ltUsTtv0v6kc5IfAbnGC9PUcCaiCQ0/edit),
      and encourage you to browse through [Grants' RFPs, challenges and
      opportunities](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/RFPs-Challenges-Opportunities-cb39201b792c4483b90732192390a556).


      For starters, think on how your project can provide value to the Balancer
      ecosystem. Will it increase TVL on Balancer Protocol? Can it incite more
      projects to build on top of Balancer? Does it create internal growth and
      value?


      If you have a good idea, please bring it forward! 


      The Committee will respond within 2 weeks through email.


      Note that any proposals regarding educational material for trading in
      Balancer pools, general DeFi onboarding, event sponsorships etc. are best
      directed trough Marketing, which is not directly under the scope of
      Grants, but would best be presented to [Orb
      Collective](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-20-funding-proposal-for-orb-collective/3359/17).

      # **Rewards**


      The payments are made in installments based on a predefined agreement
      between the Grantee and Grants Committee to ensure that milestones are
      achieved and the risk of not completing the task is minimized.


      Applications must set a total amount required to successfully deliver the
      project, and propose a payment breakdown. Milestones and tranches need to
      be set up in a way that makes sense for both parties. Detail out
      deliverables for each milestone and their planned duration.


      Aside from funding, contributors get support in terms of access to mentors
      who work with them to ensure that the projects go on successfully and in
      cases of challenges, they will be able to resolve with the help of the
      mentors.

      # **Abandoned Grant**


      If a Grantee has ignored Committee messages for 6 weeks, we consider the
      grant stale/abandoned. To make sure we do not have endless clutter within
      our pipeline, this would be the moment to take it out of our projected
      budget and weekly/monthly updates. 


      To prevent situations like the above from happening, the Grants co-leads
      ask mentors to do monthly update calls with teams and keep a finger on the
      pulse by having weekly Telegram updates. If however it does occur, the
      Grantee will be given a warning after 4 weeks and reminder after 5. 


      After the deadline has crossed and no further contact has been
      established, the Grantee gets removed from the live grants within the
      internal documentation and also from the [live grantee
      page](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9).


      If a Grantee re-emerges and shows signs of wanting to continue their grant
      after it got declared ‘stale’, the Grantee will have to resubmit a grant
      application.
