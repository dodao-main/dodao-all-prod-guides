      ## Overview

      We help founders, startups, communities, guilds and other native internet
      entities with design & product fellowships so that they can build,
      operationalize and scale as a DAO.


      ## What is DAOcubator ?

      DAOcubator is the incubator for modern day organizations built on Web 3.0
      technology and practice decentralized governance. We are a DAO of DAOs
      that help with scaling, operations and governance.


      ## Why DAOs ?

      DAOs by definition are decentralized organizations, structured to function
      autonomously and achieve a shared common objective. Membership, decision
      making, and funding are coordinated in public on a tamper-proof
      blockchain.


      ## Applications for DAOs

      On top of the protocol, we are developing its first application, which
      decentralizes hiring practices in an internet-native organization. It
      seamlessly connects people and organizations through skills.
