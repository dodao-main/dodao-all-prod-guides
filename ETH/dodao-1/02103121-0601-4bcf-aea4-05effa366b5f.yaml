      There are already so many blockchain courses then why do we need another
      course? 


      The reason are


      1. There are definitely some basic courses, but there are only a few
      courses that cover advanced Developer Concepts & Tools, DeFi, or NFT
      topics.

      2. We want to cover all the advanced topics in DoDAO and to be able to
      write advanced courses, we need to have basic information/courses in place
      first.

      3. Once done with basic topics, we will work on the advanced topics.

      4. DoDAO is an onboarding platform, i.e. we educate the users about
      various projects. Understanding these blockchain projects needs a lot of
      basic blockchain knowledge. These courses can then be reused when we
      develop onboarding content for various projects.
       
      Note: We would want our courses to be completely free for everyone and
      forever.

      There are many video courses, but these is less focus on creating
      summarized content and on creating questions bank. 


      So our focus is to reuse the videos from youtube, but create high quality
      summaries and question banks.


      There were couple of suggestions which we will also include


      1. Create mind maps - Suggestion by Lakshya. This can be done after we are
      done with all the chapters. We will create mind map for each chapter and
      this will be paid work.


      2. Incentivize course completion - Allow users to download all the
      mind-maps once they complete the full course. This was recommended by
      Raghav


      3. Assignments and Solutions - Add 2-4 assignments for each chapter with
      the solutions.


      4. Video Annotations - Annotating the Youtube Videos with relevant
      timestamps and questions. We will allow skipping of parts of the video and
      also show questions on top of videos 


      Note: Please recommend at least one idea in the #discussions channel under
      courses

      Our basic courses will consist of 6-10 chapters and in each chapter we
      will cover


      1. Readings - we call it readings, but this is the list of videos one can
      watch on Youtube to know about the topic. We should capture max of 3-4
      videos for each chapter.

      2. Summaries - This is a list of sub-topics in a chapter which we will
      summarize. Intent is the user can revise each and every concept in the
      chapter by going through the bullet points. Please look at "Two Minute
      Drill" sections in SCJP book
      ([https://firozstar.tripod.com/_darksiderg.pdf](https://firozstar.tripod.com/_darksiderg.pdf)) 

      3. Questions - About 50 high quality single or multiple choice questions
      for each chapter. We want to write max 2-3 true/false questions. Almost in
      all cases the question should have at least 4 choices.

      Currently contributing to courses involves working on a chapter which has
      "two" tasks

      1. Readings and Summaries - Create yaml file with details of readings and
      summaries for that chapter. e.g.
      [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/summaries/data_types.yaml](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/summaries/data_types.yaml)

      2. Questions - Create 50 high quality single or multiple choice questions
      for the chapter you are working on. e.g.
      [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/questions/data_types.yaml](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/questions/data_types.yaml)


      Later on we will add another task i.e. creating of the mind maps for each
      chapter, but for now its not needed. 


      Also make sure that your name is added on a Trello card corresponding to
      the task you are working on.
