      DAOs are decentralized, transparent, autonomous, smart contract-based,
      community-owned organizations that function without the presence of a
      centralized structure, apex body and intermediaries. DAOs are the future
      of work and will replace the traditional organizations quite soon in
      various diverse segments.


      DoDAO serves as the Wikipedia of DAOs by providing comprehensive and
      holistic information about the DAOs. 


      Detailed information plays a very important role in the adoption of new
      processes or technology. DAOs transform the way we think and run
      organizations and DoDAO tries to be part of this movement by being the
      resource hub for DAOs providing educational content in the form of Blogs,
      Information on DAOs &  DAO Frameworks, and News Articles.
