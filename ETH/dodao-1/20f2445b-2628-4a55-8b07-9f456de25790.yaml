      One of the primary objectives of DoDAO is to provide authentic, reliable
      and easy to understand information in order to simplify and facilitate the
      process of onboarding.

      DoDAO aims to make this onboarding process accessible, simplified and
      detailed.The guides created by DoDAO serve as the medium to accomplish
      this objective and ensure that the interested individuals are provided
      with all the information needed to join the DAO community and start
      contributing. 

      Hence, the presence of contribution/joining and incentivization
      information is a prerequisite for creating a guide.

      This guide explains how to create a guide for contribution and onboarding.

      This guide is the second step after picking a DAO and accumulating all the
      relevant links.

      Creating a guide is a simple and user-friendly process which involves
      understanding of the project undertaken, gaining knowledge about the
      contribution and incentivization mechanism and then curating the content
      in a simplified and systematic manner.

      This step involves in depth understanding of the links and the information
      enclosed therein.


      The prospective contributors need to note down all the relevant points
      with respect to the guide and capture all the valuable information that
      shall prove to be helpful to everyone who wishes to join the DAO.


      The contributors, while curating the content, need to capture only the
      relevant information pertaining to joining, contribution, incentivization
      and connecting.


      Here, the contributors need to visit the links for official documentation
      and the social media handles mentioned in the word document in order to
      filter out useful and relevant information.

      The last stage of the guide involves adding the questions for each step
      mentioned in the guide. These questions serve as an interesting testing
      mechanism to assess the understanding of the individuals who went through
      the guide. 


      The contributors need to add 2-5 questions for the steps of Introduction,
      how to contribute and incentivization based on the information present in
      the guide.


      The questions may be ranging from easy to medium difficulty level to
      precisely check the understanding of the prospective contributors. These
      questions need to be added in the word document for content. 


      The questions can be single response or multiple response type of
      questions with choices available.

      After curating and mentioning the questions along with the options, the
      content creators need to make the correct choices bold by formatting.
