      ## About DoDAO

      DoDAO is an educational hub and offers onboarding platform for DAOs. 


      We believe that DAOs will play a fundamental role in transforming the way
      in which organizations operate. We want to be a part of the DAO movement
      by providing educational content and developing an onboarding platform to
      help DAOs onboard their members.  


      DAOs or Blockchain projects operate in an open way i.e. open discussion
      forums, chats, meetings, code etc. Although each of the discord servers of
      the crypto projects has more than 2-5k members, only a handful of the
      members actively participate or contribute. The reason is that the new
      members are simply not aware of how to get started, where to contribute,
      what reward to expect etc. This leads to the loss of opportunity for both
      the DAOs/crypto projects and the members who wanted to join the projects.


      We believe, the gap can be bridged by providing interactive and
      to-the-point guided content to new members along with some quizzes. For
      example, there can be different guides for content writers, developers,
      and marketers. Here is an example of such a guide meant for content
      writers willing to join us.

      ## DoDAO Educational Hub

      https://www.dodao.io/ - For DoDAO Educational Hub!, Our goal is to become
      the foremost resource for everything related to DAOs. We will be providing
      educational content in the form of articles and videos. We hope that this
      wiki will help people learn about DAOs and how they can be used to create
      value. The articles will be divided into four below categories


      1) DAO Frameworks - DAO Frameworks are sets of tools that allow DAOs to
      improve their collaboration, governance, and operations. The frameworks
      provide templates and best practices that help DAOs to get up and running
      quickly while still maintaining a high degree of standardization.

      2) DAOs - We talk about the mission, governance, current state, tokenomics
      etc of the DAOs

      3) Bogs - There are general informative articles

      4) News - The DAO space is constantly evolving with new projects and
      announcements. In this section, we provide an overview of the latest news
      in the DAO space

      https://eth.dodao.io/ - DoDAOs onboarding platform enables DAOs to create
      interactive onboarding content in the form of guides. Our guides are far
      better than normal documentation in a number of ways

      1) Guides are to-the-point and are meant to onboard users for a specific
      role or task.

      2) Information is presented to the user in a piece-by-piece way i.e. in
      steps.

      3) Guides have evaluation steps that force the user to go through the
      contents carefully

      4) Guide completion is tracked i.e. we know the user's wallet address,
      completion date, and score.

      5) Guides can capture user inputs like their name, email, discord username
      etc.

      6) We can get guide completion updates in Discord 

      7) This data can be queried to apply smart logic like: gating of discord
      channels, gating of product boards, and proposal voting.


      You yourself can see these advantages by giving our guides a try
