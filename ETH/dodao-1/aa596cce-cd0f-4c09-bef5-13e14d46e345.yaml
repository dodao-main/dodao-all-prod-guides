      DoDAO serves as the Wikipedia of DAOs by providing comprehensive,
      inclusive and holistic information about the DAOs.


      The primary objective is to apprise the audiences of all the DAOs and
      assist the interested individuals in the onboarding procedure.


      Here, we create various guides in order to provide information about the
      contribution methods, rewards and benefits and incentivization mechanism
      of various decentralized Autonomous Organizations so as to facilitate the
      process of onboarding and ensure that the interested individuals are
      provided with all the information needed to join the DAO community and
      start contributing. 

      DoDAO aims to make this onboarding process accessible, simplified and
      detailed.

      To accomplish these objectives, the following elements relating to the DAO
      are captured in each guide-


      All the details of the project including the mission, vision purpose and
      objectives of the DAO

      Detailed information on “How to Contribute” including various venues,
      methods and fields to contribute to the DAO.

      All the Information relating to the rewards, benefits and incentives the
      onboarded members shall receive.


      The availability of above mentioned points is crucial for the guides.
      Therefore, individuals can proceed forward with creating a guide if this
      information is available.

      Another important point to be noted here is that the individuals who have
      taken up a DAO for creating a guide need to ensure that no one else has
      previously covered this guide. The information about the guides covered is
      available at the notion page.

      DAOs are the next big trend in the corporate world and are rapidly gaining
      momentum. DoDAO aims to create onboarding guides for all the DAOs and
      serve as a pioneer in this up and coming revolutionary DAO era. Here,
      various valuable links are mentioned to find the DAOs.


      The content creators need to pick up a DAO, find relevant information
      about contribution and rewards thereafter. These links shall assist the
      contributors in finding various DAOs.

      Here, before selecting a DAO for guide creation, two immensely important
      aspects need to be considered -

      * The contributors need to join the Discord channel and ensure that the
      DAO has a minimum 2000 members.

      * The contribution and incentivization information should be available
      through various sources.



      Make sure the DAO you are trying to target is not included in

      For creating the guide, accurate and authentic information is a
      prerequisite. Before working on the guide the content writers need to
      acquire all the information pertaining to the DAO.

      Most of the projects have their official documentation available on their
      website and social media handles. 


      The content writers need to acquire and organize the information relating
      to the introduction, contribution and incentivization of the DAO.

      All the required information is present in the official documentation
      which can be accessed from the official website of the DAO. 


      The content creators can also find this information via the Discord,
      Telegram and Twitter handle of the project. However, it must be ensured
      that the information added is completely updated, precise, authentic,
      accurate, detail oriented, serves the purpose and adds value to the
      readers.

      After finding the information, there is the need to create a Word Document
      with all the relevant information found along with the links to the
      acquired information.

      The content creators need to keep in mind that this step lays down only
      the groundwork for writing a guide, and does not involve the actual
      writing of the guide.

      Finding this information and noting this should ideally take around 30
      minutes to 2 hours of time.

      Initially, this step may take a bit more time, but this shall prove to be
      an extremely easy process thereafter.


      The document needs to include all the information relating to the
      contribution, incentivization, mission statement, vision of the DAO and
      onboarding process along with the links.

      If the content mentioned is accurate and appreciable, it shall be accepted
      and the creators can then move on to the next step.

      There are a plethora of benefits associated with the creation of guides.
      The contributors shall learn and gain knowledge pertaining to diverse
      projects which shall help them expand their horizon in the DAO space. 

      DoDAO also provides monetary compensation for the guides created to reward
      the contribution made by the contributors. For each project undertaken or
      each DAO covered, the contributors shall be rewarded with $10. However, an
      important point to note here is that the compensation shall be provided
      only after the deliverable submitted is accepted.
