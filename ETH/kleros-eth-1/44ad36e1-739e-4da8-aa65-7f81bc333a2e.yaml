      [Proof of
      Humanity](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-an-explainer/), a
      Sybil-resistant (=duplicate and bot-proof) registry of humans.


      Proof of Humanity (PoH) is a social identity verification system for
      humans on Ethereum. PoH combines webs of trust, reverse Turing tests, and
      dispute resolution to create a Sybil-proof list of humans. It can be used
      in a variety of existing and new applications that need identity
      solutions. Each user will need to prove they are real humans and not
      duplicate/fake/bot accounts. 


      Registered humans will accrue 1 [UBI
      Token](https://blog.kleros.io/introducing-ubi-universal-basic-income-for-humans/)
      every hour that will get streamed directly to their wallet address. The
      UBI Token is a universal income currency which is accrued by all profiles
      successfully registered in the Proof of Humanity registry.

      [Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/) is a system combining
      social verification with video submission to create a Sybil-proof list of
      humans.


      Building this type of advanced identity registry is not an end in itself.
      It is a point-of-entry to a myriad of new use cases that require
      Sybil-resistance (duplicate resistance) and can also be plugged into a
      variety of existing and new applications in need for such identity
      systems.


      There are lots of amazing use cases and reasons to be on the PoH registry.
      Let's browse through a non-exhaustive list of use cases that benefit from
      PoH:


      * Universal Basic Income (UBI)

      * Innovative DAO frameworks

      * Better Funding Mechanisms

      * Universal Identifiers and Self-Sovereign Identities

      * Certification and Reputation Systems

      * Sybil-Resistant Airdrops (fair airdrop), Yield Farming and NFT
      Distribution

      * Anti-Spam Tools

      * Sidechains Secured by Proof-of-Humanity Consensus


      To learn more about the use cases mentioned above, check this [explainer
      blog](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-a-building-block-for-the-internet-of-the-future/).

      Now that you have a basic understanding of what PoH is and its use cases,
      the next step is to learn how to prove you are human and get registered in
      the registry.


      1. First, head on over to
      [app.proofofhumanity.id](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) and you’ll be
      greeted by a screen similar to the above.


      2. Next, connect your Ethereum / Web3 wallet.


      3. Then click on "Submit profile" in the top banner.


      4. After that, you will be asked to fill out the information required to
      submit a profile. Just fill out all the necessary information and read the
      [Registry
      Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmXDiiBAizCPoLqHvcfTzuMT7uvFEe1j3s4TgoWWd4k5np/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy-v1.3.pdf).


      5. Once you’re done, click submit, pay the deposit, and find a voucher.


      Note: You will need to have a Submitter Deposit of 0.111 ETH (an amount of
      ETH you lock with the submission of your profile that will act as an
      incentive for potential challengers) which will be reimbursed once you’re
      successfully registered.


      To make sure you get the registration right and avoid getting challenged,
      make sure to read this [PoH
      tutorial](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity/proof-of-humanity-tutorial).


      For an example of how to do it right, check out [Vitalik
      Buterin’s](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/profile/0x1db3439a222c519ab44bb1144fc28167b4fa6ee6)

      If you want to help to maintain the PoH registry and earn money by
      spotting fake, bot, and incorrect profiles, you will need to learn how to
      challenge these types of profiles when they are in "Pending Registration"
      status for 3.5 days.


      As mentioned previously, users registering on PoH registry will need to
      have a Submitter Deposit which will serve as an incentive for challengers
      if a submission is proven to be incorrect, fake, duplicate or doesn’t meet
      the requirements set in the [Registry
      Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmXDiiBAizCPoLqHvcfTzuMT7uvFEe1j3s4TgoWWd4k5np/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy-v1.3.pdf).


      **Note:** You can only earn money by successfully challenging a profile in
      the “Pending Registration” phase. And as a challenger, you will also need
      to put up a Challenger Deposit which will act as a deterrent to prevent
      people from challenging profiles for no valid reason. 

      * If your challenge of the profile is successful, you get your challenger
      deposit back and earn the Submitter Deposit (minus arbitration fees). 

      * If you have challenged a valid profile, you will lose this deposit.


      To learn more how to properly challenge a submission, check this
      [tutorial](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity/proof-humanity-tutorial-remove-and-challenge).

      PoH DAO is looking forward to onboarding more humans into its growing
      community and distributing Universal Basic Income to as many people as it
      can. With this short guide, we will guide you on how to onboard more
      people in the PoH registry, including your family, friends and colleagues!


      The first step is to share this PoH onboarding guide to anyone interested
      in joining the community. Anyone who finishes this guide will be eligible
      to claim a ‘Human Badge’ (NFT) on Project Galaxy.


      Make sure to share this [PoH
      tutorial](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity) and
      have them read and understand the [Registry
      Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmXDiiBAizCPoLqHvcfTzuMT7uvFEe1j3s4TgoWWd4k5np/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy-v1.3.pdf).
      If you have questions or need help in understanding the policy and the
      registration tutorials, you can ask for help in the community.


      If users can’t afford to pay the Submitter Deposit, they can also join
      using crowdfunding. "**Crowdfund**" means you want to submit your profile
      without paying or only partially paying for the deposit. To be eligible
      for crowdfunding, make sure to finish this guide to claim the badge and
      join the PoH community (links will be provided in the next section of this
      guide).
