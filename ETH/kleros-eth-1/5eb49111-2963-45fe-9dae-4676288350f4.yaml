      In this lesson, you will have a short introduction to the course and you
      will learn the key concepts of the blockchain revolution: why Web3 is a
      new iteration of the Internet and how it is different from Web2, the
      Internet controlled by the big tech companies of Silicon Valley. 


      Watch this short recording of this first lesson by Kleros's CEO, Federico
      Ast before moving to the subsequent pages to test your knowledge!

      Let's test your understanding of how the Blockchain Revolution came about,
      and how Web3 protocols and applications contrast with their Web2
      counterparts.

      The Protocol Sink Thesis is a great framework to understand the long-term
      viability of Web3 projects. Let's test our understanding of this concept!

              Protocols become more 'dense' as they are built on by other
              protocol/projects, and will tend to settle towards the bottom of
              the Protocol Sink.

              The more trustless, permissionless and credibly neutral a protocol
              is the further it can scale to become a global platform.

              of their Web2 counterparts.

              There is less supplier risk, as services built in a decentralized
              manner are uncensorable and more transparent.
            key: b0402f0b
          - content: >-
              The response time of decentralized API services are definitely
              better than Web2 alternatives.
            key: 3999d7e4
          - content: >-
              The cost and business models of the suppliers are more attuned
              towards the interests of the customers, and are less likely to
              tend towards rent-seeking behaviour as they scale.

              A protocol is credibly neutral if it is not created by a single
              centralized entity.
            key: 1bf195d0
          - content: >-
              Anything can be considered credibly neutral if it does not extract
              rent and payments from its users.
            key: 88d74521
          - content: >-
              A credible neutral protocol is built on rules that doesn't
              arbitrarily benefit some group of users over others.
