      # Overview of Uniswap Community Analytics Program


      Uniswap is a leading decentralized crypto trading protocol that allows
      users to swap, earn and build on the Uniswap protocol. There are basically
      four components of Uniswap. They are:

      1. Uniswap labs refer to the company that built the Uniswap protocol
      alongside the web interface.

      2. Uniswap protocol is a non-upgradable smart contract that allows for
      peer-to-peer market makers to provide liquidity while making it easy for
      people to swap ERC-20 tokens.

      3. The Uniswap Interface is the web interface that allows easy access to
      the Uniswap protocol.

      4. The Uniswap governance is the community governance of the Uniswap
      protocol made possible by the UNI token.

      # Community Analytics Program


      The community analytics program was designed to crowdsource insights from
      Uniswap data for information it needs as well as onboard new members into
      the community. 


      The program runs as a bounty competition on a bi-weekly basis. At the end
      of each competition, UNI governance tokens are distributed based on
      performance.


      With this program, members of the community can be educated on the
      information gathered which will eventually drive growth.
